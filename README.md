# tyuo

*tyuo* is a Markov-chain-based chatterbot, inspired by
[Jason Hutchens' MegaHAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaHAL).

More specifically, *tyuo* is a rework of a hack against the original C-based MegaHAL,
called *yuo*, based on a limited understanding of how it worked and very rudimentary
knowledge of the language.

This implementation is almost entirely clean-room, save for the "surprise" calculation,
which was preserved for use either as a tie-breaker against *tyuo*'s own scoring model or
for more-faithful emulation of its inspiration.

Notably, this design diverges by concurrently making use of a mix of n-grams, from di-
through quintgram, trading time-to-novel production and search-space complexity against
relative quality of output.

It also deviates in that it was written entirely with a chatroom use-case in mind, rather
than evaluation by a critical judge.


## usage

This system can run as a daemon or in a terminal or however you want.
Run with `-help` to see what options exist. The most significant one is `-data-dir`.

Within the specified directory, a few files need to exist:

```
$DATA_DIR
├── contexts
│   └── <context-id>.json
└── languages
    ├── <language>.banned
    └── <language>.boring
```

Samples for all of these can be found in the `data/` directory within this project.

`boring` words are those that serve a purely functional role in framing an inquiry.
When someone wants to ask *tyuo* a question, picking these as keywords will almost certainly
lead to a response they won't want, so they're discounted as choices when parsing the input.

`banned` substrings are parts of words that should never be uttered by the chatbot.
This list protects both against *tyuo* learning phrases containing the words (avoiding undesired
n-gram paths and dictionary entries) and producing phrases containing the words if the list is
modified after learning has occurred. There is also a per-context mechanism to extend bans on
a local scale.

The design supports multiple languages, but at present, only English has been implemented.
Take a look at `tyuo/logic/language/english.go` if you want to get started on implementing another;
you have a great deal of freedom in deciding how and what your language needs to handle.
English, for example, does a fair bit of massaging to correct for unambiguous errors, but all
of its extensions are local to its parsing and formatting functions.

`<context-id>.json` is given the ID for a context as its name and contains details about how that
context should operate, all the knobs and dials that can be tweaked to affect how it learns and speaks.

With a config file in place, when *tyuo* is asked to interact with the corresponding context, it will load the config
and, if necessary, create a new `<context-id>.sqlite3` file in the same directory, which hosts its dictionaries and
n-grams.


### interaction
See `scripts/` for a few toy Python scripts that demonstrate how to interact with this system in a debug capacity.


## dependencies

You may need to grab these with `go get` to build this project. There shouldn't be any special versioning requirements.

First-party dependencies; you shouldn't have any concerns about introducing these:

- `golang.org/x/text/cases`
- `golang.org/x/text/language`
- `golang.org/x/text/runes`
- `golang.org/x/text/transform`
- `golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm`

Third-party dependencies; these are pretty mature and well-vetted:

- `github.com/juju/loggo`
  - logging
- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`
  - SQLite3 driver


## theory of operation

At its core, *tyuo* is an implementation of an [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)-based
[Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) model.
It supports digrams, trigrams, quadgrams, and quintgrams.

When given input to learn, the string, if within an acceptable domain, is lexed into a
series of digestible tokens, which are then grouped into forward- and reverse-ordered
n-grams, with the token following the n-gram becoming its transition-candidate for future
productions. A special case exists for the first n-gram in a sequence and for the last:
a "boundary" token is inserted before the first, allowing searches relative to the start
of a sequence, and another "boundary" token is inserted at the end, signifying that it's
possible for that n-gram path to end an utterance.

When generating productions, an arbitrary keytoken is chosen from the input-set and then both forward and backward
walks occur to reach a terminal state, the end of some other previously observed input. After that, each monodirectional
production fragment is fed into the same process in the opposite direction, this time beginning with its tail, hopefully
ensuring that the full path from front to back is of consistent quality. (This is in contrast to MegaHAL, which does two
independent walks from the keytoken, then directly joins them together)

If no productions can be assembled in this manner, then forward and backward walks are conducted from arbitrary
terminal-initial states, attempting to choose branches that include a keytoken along the way. This is so *tyuo* almost
always has something to say, even if it ends up being completely irrelevant.

To support this flow, the highest-order n-gram model is tried first in each step, successively falling back to the lowest
if no n-grams match the head/tail in its current state; if no matching n-grams can be found, then that production fails
and it's up to the other searches to yeild usable results.

After all productions have been generated, they are scored and everything that meets minimum viable criteria is presented
to the caller, with scoring results, so it can pick the most suitable option for its needs.


### implementation details

*tyuo* uses an isolated SQLite3 database to serve each context. There is no common memory or overlap between them,
though it does share language-level banned and boring lists.

As much as reasonably possible, *tyuo* will not hold any information in the database in memory, to reduce its process
footprint when idle, which is likely to be close to 100% of the time, given that its operations tend to be on the order
of 30ms on a Ryzen 3700X with an SSD.

One exception to this is banned tokens. It's just much more efficient to hold that relatively small set of strings and IDs in
memory to quickly filter out unwanted input without unnecessarily hitting the database.

API accesses are internally subject to a read/write-lock, allowing for threadsafe use by any number of callers.
